Howdy! 

P = Protagonist (Paranoid)
V = Villain (Vicious)
C = Cannon fodder (Comedic relief)

Why? Its just too cute!!!!!

70% MTL  
20% Proofreading  
10% Traditional TL

It's been a while since I last translated stuff and I'm too lazy to do it properly...I code more than I translate, so you might see me pop out with a few Wordpress and Hugo snippets more than translations HAHA.

### Recommendation

You are welcome to suggest novels to translate, though I reserve the right to decide whether to translate them or not.

- Under: 500,000 characters (~130 chapters)
- Has: A PVC MC and a PVC ML
- Not: Involve some CEO, entertainment circle (gaming OK) or omegaverse (incl. MPreg)
- Prefer: Comedy & cannon fodder MCs

### Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this site either with your translations (I doubt), proofreading, rehosting or something else, you must be comfortable with learning & using markdown. Just leave a comment below.

### Retranslation

You are welcome to share, distribute, re-translate, print, make adaptations etc for non-commercial purposes only. However, please take it down if contacted by the copyright owners.

**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"  
**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"  
**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"

I kid you not, they are the most irritating messages you can get. I'll literally say no if you ask me.

### Shameless comments, coz I like to show off my site(s)

No ads, which is pretty impressive for a static site I hope! This site is a static one built with Hugo, hosted on Github + deployed on Netlify. The comments box is made from Remark42, coz the free version of Disqus still has ads/tracking, and that's hosted by a Docker container in a free Oracle server. The setup is free, so technically I could buy a domain name (~$10 per year) and make this site super professional-looking but nahhhh.

My personal portfolio site uses the same kind of setup (but with a proper domain name I guess), so some of the javascript is hosted on that. You may see it around if you like to snoop around a site's source code (I know I check sites with BuiltWith all the time)!
