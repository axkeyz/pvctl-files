Howdy! 

P = Protagonist  
V = Villain  
C = Cannon fodder

Why? Its just too cute!!!!!

70% MTL  
20% Proofreading  
10% Traditional TL

It's been a while since I last translated stuff and I'm too lazy to do it properly...I code more than I translate, so you might see me pop out with a few Wordpress and Hugo snippets.

### Recommendation

You are welcome to suggest novels to translate, though I reserve the right to decide whether to translate them or not.

- Under: 600,000 characters (~120 chapters)
- Has: A PVC MC and a PVC ML
- Not: Involve some CEO, entertainment circle (gaming OK) or omegaverse (incl. MPreg)
- Prefer: Comedy & cannon fodder MCs

### Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this site either with your translations (I doubt), proofreading, rehosting or something else, you must be comfortable with learning & using markdown. Just leave a comment below.

### Retranslation

You are welcome to share, distribute, re-translate, print, make adaptations etc for non-commercial purposes only. However, please take it down if contacted by the copyright owners.

**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"  
**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"  
**DO NOT** contact me about retranslations! Just go ahead!"

I kid you not, they are the most irritating messages you can get. I'll literally say no if you ask me.
