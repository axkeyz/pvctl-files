The MCs of the novels being translated on this site often transmigrate into similar types of novels. There are a few terms that are very typical to the genres of the "original" story. While you may have seen them before, here's a list of them in case you haven't. I'll also leave a translation note the first time they appear in the novel.

- **Cannon Fodder**: The minor villains that are killed within 1-5 chapters from their first appearance. They're oftentimes unnamed, with a 1D personality and are gone before you could call them a villain.

- **Golden Finger**: A cheat, ranging from overpowered items, to stats, systems, luck etcâ€¦ They can often be upgraded, making the protagonist ever more overpowered.

- **Stallion (Novel/Protagonist)**: A stallion novel involves a man with a massive harem of like 300+ women. A stallion protagonist is a protagonist with a massive harem.
