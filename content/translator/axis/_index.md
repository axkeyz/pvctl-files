Howdy! I've translated under the name "xah" aaaaages ago, you may have seen me around lol. I think I have translated under this handle before though. After I stopped translating stuff, I kinda got into gaming and coding. I still suck at both tbh lol, but fun is fun.

I usually use a combination of names from *xah*, *Axis Key (axkeyz/keyz)* or *Baxton*. If you see one of those in the comments, it's probably me.
