summary: "Lin Shenyu read a stallion novel set in a zombie apocalypse. The male protagonist was ruthless and cold-blooded, stepping on the bones of thousands of villains to reach the top. Which is fine, but Lin Shenyu was forced to transmigrate into the novel as a cannon fodder right after the stabbing scene. Uh...is it too late to put down the knife now?"

notes:
    - author: "Sorry it ended so quickly. It was mainly because their relationship progressed too fast, and I ran out of stuff to write about. I was also reluctant to make too many twists. QwQ."
    - translator: "Despite how fast it was, I still kinda liked it. There are some glaring things that the author could've done better, but I'll give this a solid 7/10 just for the humour. Plus, it's short, so it won't waste too much time I guess."
