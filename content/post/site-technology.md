Hey! I'm surprised you managed to stumble on this page. This is a bit of a brag post to brag about this site, since I don't really have any other places to do it.

The dark-mode should be toggled automatically for you dark-mode users, but you can always make the theme light again. I'm pretty proud of it (and it's suprisingly pretty easy to do). This site was originally dark-themed as I 100% prefer dark. It was much later when I added a light mode, coz I heard that people find it easier to read light backgrounds (why?? I don't understand but suuure).

This site is built with Hugo, stored on Github and deployed on Netlify. All the files are on my computer, so finding and replacing errors is nice and easy. My TOCs are automatic, links to posts are automatic and my tags look just the way I want them too. I am bloody proud and love it hahaha.

This site is 100% ad-less. I even stripped out Disqus who is notorious for adding trackers and forced ads to its free users. Hence, I replaced it with Remark42, which is hosted on a free Oracle server (VM). I also took out Google Analytics coz I figured there wasn't much point knowing that much about y'all.

I won't guarantee that it'll stay 100% ad-less or tracker less. I am considering having some ads for the sole-purpose of purchasing raws. But if I'm going to do ads, they'll be stuff I put here, not stuff that got forced onto here by third parties.

Overall, I'd say there's quite a few free options to host a site with a low number of visitors. Or about $10 per year (just pay for a domain name) to make such a site a bit more fancy.

I could connect this whole (free) setup to a domain name, but I think it's kind of a waste of money for a site that'll probably only host 1~2 novels in its lifetime. $10 per year is still $10, plus I'd prefer my site to always be around somewhere.

My own site has this setup, but has been connected to a domain name. Sadly, this site is better than my "portfolio" site. Too bad. Lol.
