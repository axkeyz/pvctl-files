Protagonist-centric novels, or stallion novels, are often one where the protagonist becomes extremely overpowered. They often go through a long period of suffering, but eventually luck turns on their side as they're a "son of the heavens". They then start beating up bullies (a type of cannon fodder) with their golden finger(s) (cheats) and start collecting a massive harem.

The MCs of the novels being translated on this site often transmigrate into these types of novels (because straight men being bent is cute as hell).

If you found any of the above confusing, you can refer to the glossary below.

### Glossary

- {{< green "Bootlicking dog/lackey" >}}: Literally, "licking dog" or "dog leg" (depending on which novel). Usually refers to a person who dishes out their dignity in order to get into the good books of a particular person (bootlicker). I tend to translate this to "bootlicker" (derrogatory), "bootlicking dog" (derrogatory), "bootlicking puppy" (kinda cute) or "lackey" (neutral) depending on context.

- {{< green "Cannon fodder" >}}: The minor characters that are killed within 1-5 chapters from their first appearance. They're oftentimes unnamed, with a 1D personality and are gone before you could call them anything. They can be good (dies for an important character), neutral (background character, usually dies from sickness/war) or bad (former bully towards the protagonist).

- {{< green "Golden finger" >}}: A cheat, ranging from overpowered items, to stats, systems, luck etcâ€¦ They can often be upgraded, making the protagonist ever more overpowered.

- {{< green "Son of the heavens" >}}: Someone favoured by the heavens (often after suffering) and proceeds to run rampant (so-called justice). May also be known as a "Long Aotian" or something that has "dragon" and "heavens" in it.

- {{< green "Stallion novel/protagonist" >}}: A stallion novel usually involves a (male) protagonist with a massive harem of like 300+ women.

- {{< green "Storage ring">}}: An abstract space or item (e.g. ring) that can hold an impossibly huge amount of stuff. The items often preserve its original status before being added to the storage space. This is considered to be an important "golden finger" of the protagonist.
